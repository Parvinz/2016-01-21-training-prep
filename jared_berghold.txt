My name is Jared Berghold. I am an eResearch Analyst at Intersect. I assist, train and advise researchers on the use of computer-based technology in their research. Prior to working at Intersect, I spent four years at the UNSW research centre, iCinema, developing software for large-scale immersive and interactive installations.
